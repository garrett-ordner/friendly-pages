This template was developed by Garrett Ordner, recording clerk and webmaster for the [Baton Rouge Friends Meeting](https://batonrougequakers.org). I had the idea for this template while working on the meeting's website. Organizations with few technical skills may find themselves drawn to "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) website builders that allow the construction of a site at no cost.  However, building a website through those builders requires hosting it with them as well, which can cost upwards of $200 a year. 

I wanted small organizations to have the option to set up a website in minutes at minimal cost. To that end, this project allows users to launch the template as a website on Netlify with the click of a button (as well as a few guided steps at Netlify) and also seeks to guide users through configuring a low-cost domain name from [Cloudflare](https://Cloudflare.com).
