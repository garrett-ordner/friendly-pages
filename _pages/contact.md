Set your contact email and phone number in the _config.yml file. I recommend setting up email routing through [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), which is free with your domain. A guide to do this will be added to the README soon.

Optionally, you can get a free contact form from [Formspree](https://formspree.io).

You can email us at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>, or call {{ site.phone }}.
